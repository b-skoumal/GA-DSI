    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab draws on everything you've covered in Pandas and stats so far this week:\n",
    "- cleaning data\n",
    "- changing data types\n",
    "- subsetting using booleans, slicing, and indexing\n",
    "- pivot tables and value counts\n",
    "- hypothesis testing and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use the following Crunchbase [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneel0101/lesson-plan/master/crunchbase_monthly_export.csv), which has information on 44,000 startups and how much funding they've received.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimum Requirements:\n",
    "- change the data types of each numeric column to int\n",
    "- find all the missing values in one column\n",
    "- replace all the missing values in a column with the median of that column\n",
    "- create a subset of US-based companies the data using booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Requirements:\n",
    "- work through all the cells in the workbook not marked challenge\n",
    "- clean the data using .apply() and lambda functions whenever possible\n",
    "- create a hypothesis about the data and test it with a t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge Requirements:\n",
    "- complete everything from the expected requirements\n",
    "- complete every cell marked challenge: run additional statistical tests, plot your results, continue to segment your analysis by new variables\n"
